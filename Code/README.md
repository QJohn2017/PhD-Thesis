This material contains the code used to produce the figures in the thesis

> Electron dynamics in complex time and complex space. E. Pisanty, PhD Thesis, Imperial College London (2016).

It consists of a number of Mathematica notebooks that create and export the figures as used in the thesis as submitted for examination. In addition, this collection includes the data files used for the figures where the calculation is longer than reasonable.

This collection has a number of dependencies:

 - The ARMSupport package, by the author, available at https://github.com/episanty/ARMSupport
 - The EPToolbox package, by the author, available at https://github.com/episanty/EPToolbox
 - The RB-SFA package, by the author, available at https://github.com/episanty/RB-SFA

 - The MaTeX package by Szabolcs Horvát, available at https://github.com/szhorvat/MaTeX
 - The Latin Modern Math font, available at http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/lm-math/download.

The package files used in the thesis are included for completeness; for their documentation and further details, see their homepages as detailed above.

The code is made available under the GNU Public License v3: you are free to reuse it in private, but if you make it, or your modifications, available to others, it should be under GPL-compatible terms.

In addition to this legal obligation, you have the academic obligation to cite the source if you use the code in this package in an academic publication. For this, a citation to the PhD thesis (as cited above) is sufficient, though if you only use the associated packages then the appropriate citation as described on their homepages is also welcome.
