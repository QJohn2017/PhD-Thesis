  abstract = {In this paper, we present a discussion of the role that angular momentum plays in the interaction of an intense laser field with a single-electron atom. To do this, we have made a detailed analysis of how different partial waves, i.e., different angular momentum states, participate in producing the photoelectron energy, angular distributions, and harmonic generation spectra. We show that the two regimes—tunneling and multiphoton excitation—correspond to quite distinct evolution patterns across the partial wave decomposition. The natures of these patterns are particularly significant in the harmonic generation spectra and emphasize how harmonic generation is mainly produced in transitions back to the initial state. We also find that at high intensities, the photoelectron energy spectrum is composed of two different but well defined sets of above-threshold ionization peaks. These two sets are separated by a structureless region and the second set deviates substantially from the initial exponential decrease of the peak intensities versus energy. Similar features have been very recently reported experimentally.}

Instead of a Gaussian shape predicted by standard tunnelling theory, the experimental data exhibit a sharp cusp-like peak at zero transverse momentum. The comparison of experimental data with (i) calculations performed within the strong-field approximation employing a Coulomb–Volkov wavefunction to model the final electron state and (ii) results of recent semiclassical calculations, shows that the 'cusp' appears due to the long-range Coulomb interaction between the emitted electron and the remaining ion. A similar structure was previously observed for ion–atom collisions.}

Analysis indicates that the Coulomb attraction of the parent core to the returning electron is responsible for the focusing of the electron transverse momentum. Moreover, the strong dependence of the focusing of the electron transverse momentum on the laser wavelength and intensity is discussed.}

The found interference effects are shown to play an important role in the formation of the electron angular and momentum distribution, strong left – right asymmetry of the electron ejection, observed carrier-envelope phase (CEP) effects and formation of the lowenergy electrons in continuum. In addition, the arising new features of atomic dynamics in a strong field are confirmed to take place in a quasistatic regime of ionization in the case of middle IR laser frequency.}

It is found that even harmonics appear due to the magnetic field component direction perpendicular to the electric field polarization with intensities about two orders of magnitude less than the odd harmonics emitted along the electric field polarization. The even harmonics exhibit plateaus with cutoffs which exceed in intensity the odd harmonic plateaus and maximum energies predicted by semiclassical electron recollision models. Although the spectra are weak, the wavelength of the recollision electron in the maximum energy regions correspond to subatomic dimensions and the corresponding emitted photons have subnanometer wavelengths.}

Each lobe is associated with its own characteristic electron dynamics.

The model takes into account the evolution of the electronic wave function in terms of the action and trajectory of a classical electron.

It is an extension of the well-known strong-field approximation and the dipole Volkov states to the case of space-dependent fields, in the very-high-frequency regime. The great advantage of the model lies in its applicability in situations where the dipole approximation does not hold and, therefore, ab initio numerical computation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation would require extremely long run times.}

However, it is found that the dipole approximation breaks down even if the electron remains delocalised over a region less than 1 nm.},
